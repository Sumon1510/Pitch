**Pitch for MyVote: Empowering Every Citizen to Vote from Anywhere**

**Introduction:**

In today's globalized world, many citizens find themselves away from their hometowns on election day due to work, education, or travel. This situation prevents them from exercising their fundamental right to vote, leading to lower voter turnout and less representative elections. Introducing **MyVote**, the innovative mobile app designed to ensure that every citizen can participate in elections, no matter where they are.

**The Problem:**

Traditional voting systems require physical presence at polling stations, disenfranchising citizens who are not in their registered locations on election day. This results in significant portions of the electorate being unable to cast their votes, thereby weakening the democratic process.
